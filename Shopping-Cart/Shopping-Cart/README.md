# Shopping-Cart
A simple shopping cart made with vanilla js, css3 and htm5. Implementation of Local Storage is also carried out. Contentful is used to consume the API for the products,
hence you need a local server to run on the machine. It can be a live server from visual studio code or any other local server such as use of XAMPP etc...
In order to consume local data,  you can use products.json file available and just comment out the code requesting contentful and uncomment the local data consuming code.
